# Advanced Security (Days 61â€“80)

Now it's time to level up.

The final 20 days of the bootcamp introduce **advanced techniques**, offensive tooling, and real-world adversary emulation concepts, including:

- Vulnerability scanning & assessment
- Exploitation labs and payload generation
- Threat intelligence and adversary simulation
- Purple Team methodology
- Practice challenges with tools like Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, and Wireshark
- Labs inspired by **Pentest+** and **CySA+**

This capstone phase will prepare you for deeper specialization or certification exams, with daily labs and writeups that simulate real-world scenarios.

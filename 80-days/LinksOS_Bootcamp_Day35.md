# ✅ LinkOS Bootcamp — Day 35

**Full-Time Learner Track (8–10 hours/day)**  
**Cert Focus:** CySA+ (CS0-003) — Security Monitoring & Anomaly Detection  
**Integrated Focus:** Linux+ (XK0-005) — Log analysis, system monitoring, and alert thresholds  
**Goal:** Practice behavior-based detection, build a baseline, and tune alert rules

---

## 📊 Task 1: Establish Baselines for Linux Systems

**Mapped Objectives:**  
- CySA+ 2.1 – Anomaly detection and baseline configuration  
- Linux+ – Monitor and compare system metrics and log patterns

**Actions:**  
- Use `uptime`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, `top` to establish normal system usage  
- Record logs over 1 hour and identify “expected” behavior ranges  
- Define thresholds for CPU, memory, disk, and login attempts

**Output:**  
- Markdown: `linux-baseline-observations.md`  
- Table: Metric | Normal Range | Tool Used

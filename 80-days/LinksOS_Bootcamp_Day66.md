# ✅ Link2Cyber Bootcamp — Day 66
**Full-Time Learner Track (8–10 hours/day)**  
**Cert Focus:** SecurityX (CAS-005)  
**Focus:** Incident response lifecycle, playbook creation, team roles, and tabletop scenarios  
**Tools:** HTB Academy, SIEM simulation (ELK/Wazuh logs), real-world IR project
## 🚨 Task 1: Incident Response Planning and Frameworks
**Mapped Objectives:**  
- CAS-005 Domain 3 – Incident Response and Security Operations
**Actions:**  
- Review IR phases (NIST 800-61):  
  - Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned  
- Define IR team roles: IR lead, communications, forensics, legal  
- Map internal processes to IR phases
**Output:**  
- Markdown: `securityx-incident-response-framework.md`  
- Table: IR Phase | Team Role | Tool/Task | Notes
## 🛠 Task 2: Playbooks and Response Templates
- Draft 2 playbooks:  
  1. **Ransomware on file server**  
  2. **Suspicious outbound connection from dev laptop**  
- Include decision trees, triage actions, and logs to pull
- Markdown: `securityx-response-playbooks.md`  
- Diagram: Playbook flowchart or checklist
## 🧪 Task 3: HTB Academy + Log Sample (ELK/Wazuh/THM)
### HTB Academy Module:
- [Incident Response Fundamentals](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/168)
### Optional TryHackMe:
- [Security Monitoring and SIEM](https://tryhackme.com/room/securitymonitoring)
- Markdown: `securityx-incident-lab-notes.md`  
- Screenshot: SIEM log event or response annotation
## 🛠️ Project of the Day: “IR Policy + Tabletop Scenario”
**Scenario:**  
As the new security lead, you're asked to prepare the IR policy and run a tabletop simulation for an executive team.
**Steps:**  
1. Draft 1-page IR policy for your organization  
2. Create a tabletop scenario (e.g., insider threat, stolen laptop, phishing attack)  
3. Define injects, decisions, escalation points  
4. Log what decisions teams make and reflect on response gaps
**Deliverables:**  
- Markdown: `project-ir-policy-and-tabletop.md`  
- Table: Scenario step | Team decision | Outcome | Gap

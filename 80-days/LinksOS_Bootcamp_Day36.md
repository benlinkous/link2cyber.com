# ‚úÖ LinkOS Bootcamp ‚Äî Day 36

**Full-Time Learner Track (8‚Äì10 hours/day)**  
**Cert Focus:** CySA+ (CS0-003) ‚Äî Threat Hunting, Correlation, and Detection  
**Integrated Focus:** Linux+ (XK0-005) ‚Äî Log parsing, shell scripting, and event chaining  
**Goal:** Use real-world threat intel and Linux logs to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)

## üïµÔ∏è Task 1: Threat Hunting Methodologies

**Mapped Objectives:**  
- CySA+ 3.3 ‚Äì Threat hunting techniques  
- Linux+ ‚Äì Use scripts and filters to extract behavior patterns from logs

**Actions:**  
- Define and compare:
  - IOC vs TTP vs behavior-based indicators  
  - Hypothesis-based vs analytics-driven threat hunting  
- Search system logs for:
  - Unauthorized access  
  - Suspicious network connections  
  - Abnormal privilege use

**Output:**  
- Markdown: `threat-hunting-methods.md`  
- Screenshot or logs: Sample event chain with interpretation

## üß™ Task 2: TryHackMe Labs ‚Äì Hunting and Correlation

- [TryHackMe: SOC Investigation](https://tryhackme.com/room/socinvestigation)  
- [TryHackMe: Security Onion](https://tryhackme.com/room/securityonion)

**Actions:**  
- Trace multi-stage attacks  
- Map events across multiple log sources

**Output:**  
- Markdown: `log-correlation-lab-notes.md`  
- Screenshot: Dashboard or matched logs

---

## üß∞ Task 3: Log Correlation Drill Using CLI

**Actions:**  
- Correlate log entries using:
  - `grep`, `awk`, `cut`, and `sort`  
- Build a simple shell script to:
  - Find SSH login attempts  
  - Match login to user group  
  - Identify repeated IPs

**Tools:**  
- `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, `uniq`, `bash`, `/var/log/auth.log`

**Output:**  
- Markdown: `ioc-hunting-cli.md`  
- Script: `ioc-hunter.sh`  
- Screenshot: Sample result

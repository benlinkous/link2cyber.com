# ✅ LinkOS Bootcamp — Day 36

**Full-Time Learner Track (8–10 hours/day)**  
**Cert Focus:** CySA+ (CS0-003) — Threat Hunting, Correlation, and Detection  
**Integrated Focus:** Linux+ (XK0-005) — Log parsing, shell scripting, and event chaining  
**Goal:** Use real-world threat intel and Linux logs to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)



## 🕵️ Task 1: Threat Hunting Methodologies

**Mapped Objectives:**  
- CySA+ 3.3 – Threat hunting techniques  
- Linux+ – Use scripts and filters to extract behavior patterns from logs

**Actions:**  
- Define and compare:
  - IOC vs TTP vs behavior-based indicators  
  - Hypothesis-based vs analytics-driven threat hunting  
- Search system logs for:
  - Unauthorized access  
  - Suspicious network connections  
  - Abnormal privilege use

**Output:**  
- Markdown: `threat-hunting-methods.md`  
- Screenshot or logs: Sample event chain with interpretation

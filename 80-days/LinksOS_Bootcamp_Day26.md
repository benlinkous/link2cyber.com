# ✅ Link2Cyber Bootcamp — Day 26
**Full-Time Learner Track (8–10 hours/day)**  
**Cert Focus:** Security+ (SY0-601)  
**Goal:** Begin Security+ phase by mastering threat categories, attack vectors, and basic security concepts
## 🔐 Security+ Phase Kickoff
Welcome to the final sprint! For the next five days, your focus is entirely on **Security+**. You’ve already built foundational skills — now we’ll concentrate on the domains that matter most for passing the SY0-601 exam and applying it in real-world SOC or IT roles.
## 🧠 Task 1: Threat Categories & Attack Types
**Mapped Objectives:**

  - Malware types (virus, worm, rootkit, spyware, ransomware)
  - Attack types (phishing, DoS, MITM, SQLi, XSS)
  - Threat actors and vectors (insiders, nation-state, APT, supply chain)
**Output:**  
- Markdown: `threat-types-and-vectors.md`  
- Table: Threat actor profile matrix
